## What is digital sovereignty?

Digital sovereignty is the ability of individuals, communities, and organizations to exercise meaningful control over their digital lives. It means having genuine authority over your data, the software you use, and the infrastructure that powers your online activities.

True digital sovereignty includes:

- **Data control**: Determining what information you share, with whom, and under what conditions.
- **Software freedom**: Using, examining, modifying, and sharing the code that runs your digital tools.
- **Infrastructure ownership**: Having the ability to operate your own servers and services.
- **Knowledge access**: Understanding how your technology works and being able to make informed choices.
- **Governance participation**: Having a voice in how digital systems are designed and regulated.

Digital sovereignty exists on a spectrum from complete dependency to full autonomy. The Civil Society Technology Foundation works toward shifting the balance away from centralized control and toward individual and community empowerment.

## The threat to digital sovereignty

Most people today have very little digital sovereignty. Consider your typical online experience:

- Your personal information is collected, analyzed, and monetized by corporations without meaningful consent.
- The software you use is controlled by distant companies that can change terms, features, or access at any time.
- Your content and connections depend on platforms that can censor, amplify, or de-rank what you share.
- Critical services like email, calendars, and file storage are hosted on corporate infrastructure that you cannot inspect or control.
- Algorithms shape what you see and how you communicate in ways designed to maximize corporate profit.

This lack of sovereignty is not accidental--it's the result of business models and regulatory environments that incentivize centralization and data extraction. The trend toward concentration has accelerated as digital technology has become essential to nearly every aspect of modern life.

## Individuals need digital sovereignty

For individuals, digital sovereignty affects fundamental aspects of daily life:

### Privacy and security

Without digital sovereignty, your personal information becomes vulnerable to exploitation. Your browsing history, location data, and private communications transform into corporate assets, traded and monetized without meaningful consent. Intimate details of your life face constant exposure through data breaches and surveillance, creating a permanent digital record that can be weaponized against you at any time.

Digital sovereignty changes this dynamic fundamentally. When you control your digital infrastructure, you determine what information you share and with whom. Encryption and privacy-preserving tools become standard practice rather than specialized knowledge. You can maintain clear boundaries between different aspects of your digital life, protecting both your current privacy and your future autonomy.

### Personal autonomy

Without digital sovereignty, your choices become systematically constrained by forces beyond your control. Algorithms shape not just what information you see, but what options appear available to you. Design patterns constantly nudge you toward behaviors that benefit platforms rather than yourself, while essential tasks increasingly require surrendering privacy as the price of participation.

Digital sovereignty restores meaningful choice to your daily life. You can make decisions based on diverse information sources that you've actively chosen rather than algorithmic curation. Your tools serve your needs rather than exploiting your attention for profit. Most importantly, you can participate fully in digital society without surrendering your fundamental rights or personal dignity.

### Economic security

Without digital sovereignty, you face growing economic vulnerabilities in an increasingly digital economy. Your skills and livelihood become dependent on proprietary platforms that can change terms or revoke access arbitrarily. Economic opportunities remain subject to the whims of platform policies, while the value you create online flows primarily to distant corporate owners rather than building your own wealth or community resources.

Digital sovereignty builds genuine economic resilience. You develop portable skills that transcend any specific corporate platform, ensuring your capabilities remain valuable regardless of technological shifts. You can create and connect through systems you help govern, participating in cooperative economic models that distribute value more equitably among those who generate it.

## Communities need digital sovereignty

Communities, from local neighborhoods to identity groups to civil society organizations, face particular challenges in the digital age.

### Community autonomy

Without digital sovereignty, communities lose fundamental self-determination as their governance structures become subordinated to platform rules and algorithms. Local knowledge and cultural context get systematically flattened by global platforms designed for mass consumption rather than community specificity. Meanwhile, community resources flow steadily toward distant corporations instead of circulating locally to strengthen community bonds and capacity.

Digital sovereignty enables communities to truly thrive on their own terms. They can design digital spaces that authentically reflect local values and meet specific community needs. Community standards and practices remain intact without corporate override or algorithmic interference. Most importantly, digital infrastructure becomes a genuine community asset that builds collective wealth and capacity rather than extracting value.

### Resilience against censorship

Without digital sovereignty, communities face systematic silencing through mechanisms that appear neutral but consistently harm marginalized voices. Platform policies regularly restrict legitimate speech, with enforcement patterns that disproportionately affect those with the least institutional power. Commercial content moderation systems cannot possibly reflect the nuance and context of diverse community standards, leading to decisions that undermine rather than protect community discourse.

Digital sovereignty preserves community voice through infrastructure independence. Communities can operate their own communication systems that resist external censorship while developing content moderation approaches appropriate to their specific context and values. They maintain fallback channels that cannot be easily blocked, ensuring continuity of communication even under pressure.

### Collective memory

Without digital sovereignty, community history becomes dangerously precarious as it depends entirely on corporate platforms with their own priorities and lifespans. When platforms shut down or change direction, they take irreplaceable community archives with them. Algorithmic sorting continuously buries historically important content, while corporate priorities rather than community values determine what gets preserved for future generations.

Digital sovereignty strengthens cultural continuity by giving communities control over their own historical record. They can maintain archives and documentation according to their own standards and priorities. Knowledge transfer between generations happens on community terms rather than through corporate intermediaries. Digital artifacts remain accessible and meaningful even as underlying technologies evolve, ensuring that community memory persists across technological transitions.

## Civil society needs digital sovereignty

For the non-profit and non-governmental bodies that form the backbone of democratic society, digital sovereignty is particularly crucial.

### Independence from corporate control

Without digital sovereignty, civil society becomes fundamentally compromised in its mission and effectiveness. NGOs find themselves forced to accept surveillance and data extraction as the price of accessing essential digital tools, undermining their ability to protect the communities they serve. Advocacy organizations become dependent on platforms that may actively oppose their values, while corporate philanthropy increasingly shapes which digital infrastructure gets built, prioritizing donor interests over community needs.

Digital sovereignty allows civil society to maintain its integrity and independence. Organizations can choose and use tools that genuinely align with their mission and values rather than contradicting them. Advocacy work can proceed without platform-imposed limitations that undermine effectiveness, while infrastructure development responds to actual community needs rather than market incentives or corporate priorities.

### Operational security

Without digital sovereignty, civil society organizations face escalating security risks that threaten their core work. Sensitive communications and confidential data must reside on vulnerable commercial platforms designed for profit rather than protection. Critical organizational workflows become dependent on services that can be withdrawn or modified without notice, while organizational data gets integrated into commercial AI training sets without consent or oversight.

Digital sovereignty dramatically improves operational security by returning control to the organizations themselves. They can maintain direct oversight of sensitive information rather than trusting corporate intermediaries. Communication channels become resistant to surveillance and interference, while infrastructure resilience protects against both technical disruption and political pressure.

### Ethical alignment

Without digital sovereignty, civil society faces deep contradictions that undermine moral authority and organizational effectiveness. Organizations advocating for human rights often find themselves using tools that systematically violate those same rights. Digital workflows frequently contradict stated organizational values, while resource dependencies on extractive platforms compromise advocacy positions and limit strategic options.

Digital sovereignty enables authentic alignment between values and practice. Technology choices can reflect and actively reinforce organizational principles rather than undermining them. Digital infrastructure embodies the world organizations are working to create, demonstrating alternative possibilities rather than perpetuating existing problems. Most importantly, consistency between means and ends strengthens moral authority and makes advocacy more credible and effective.

## The path to digital sovereignty

Achieving greater digital sovereignty isn't an all-or-nothing proposition. It's a journey with practical steps that individuals and organizations can take.

### For individuals

1. **Start with awareness**: Learn how your current tools work and what alternatives exist.
2. **Make incremental changes**: Replace proprietary services with open alternatives one by one.
3. **Join communities of practice**: Connect with others on similar journeys.
4. **Develop technical literacy**: Build skills to maintain more of your own technology.
5. **Support and advocate**: Contribute to projects and policies that promote digital sovereignty.

### For organizations

1. **Audit current dependencies**: Understand where you lack digital sovereignty.
2. **Prioritize critical systems**: Focus first on communications and sensitive data.
3. **Invest in capacity**: Build technical skills within your organization.
4. **Build community infrastructure**: Partner with similar organizations to share resources.
5. **Center sovereignty in planning**: Make digital autonomy a strategic priority.

The Civil Society Technology Foundation's [Wild Cloud project](/projects/wild-cloud) provides a reference implementation for individuals, communities, and organizations seeking to regain digital sovereignty. It demonstrates that practical steps toward greater independence are possible today, even with limited resources.

## Conclusion

Digital sovereignty isn't a luxury, it's increasingly essential for meaningful participation in society, for the health of communities, and for the independence of civil society. As digital technology becomes more deeply embedded in every aspect of our lives, the question of who controls that technology becomes more urgent.

The challenges are significant, but practical alternatives exist. By taking incremental steps toward greater sovereignty, we can build a digital future that enhances rather than undermines human agency, community resilience, and democratic values.

Digital sovereignty matters because it determines whether technology will serve as a tool of liberation or a mechanism of control. The choice between these futures is still ours to make--if we act with purpose and clarity about what's at stake.
