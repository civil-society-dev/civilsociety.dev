As civil society organizations become increasingly dependent on digital tools, the question of who controls that technology becomes a matter of democratic importance.

The Civil Society Technology Foundation develops and disseminates open-source, self-hosted technologies that enable genuine digital sovereignty. We provide the tools, knowledge, and community support necessary for civil society to operate independently of surveillance-based platforms and extractive business models.

Our work spans software development, educational resources, and community engagementâ€”creating pathways to technological self-determination for organizations that can't afford to compromise their values.
