The **Civil Society Technology Foundation (CSTF)** is a community-driven organization dedicated to empowering individuals and civil society organizations to reclaim digital sovereignty through open-source tools and self-hosted infrastructure.

## Our Mission

We believe that independent, community-controlled technology is essential for a vibrant civil society in the digital age. As digital systems increasingly mediate civic participation, it's vital that these systems remain under the control of the communities they serve, rather than consolidated in the hands of governments or corporations.

The Civil Society Technology Foundation works to achieve this vision through:

- **Creating Educational Resources** that build technical literacy and sovereignty awareness
- **Developing Reference Implementations** like the Sovereign Cloud for self-hosted infrastructure
- **Building Community** around sovereign technology practices and principles
- **Advancing Open Standards** that enable interoperability without centralized control
- **Supporting Civil Society Organizations** in their journey toward digital independence
